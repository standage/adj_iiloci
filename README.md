If you want to run this on your local machine, try the following.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/standage/adj_iiloci
cd adj_iiloci
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook
# Open `index.ipynb` in your browser.
```

Or you can try it on mybinder.org: less hassle with setup, but liable to be slower.
